I am a second-year dual degree university student studying computer science and business adminstration.
I enjoy problem-solving and challenging myself by taking on diffuclt projects that I am able to learn from.

<br></br>
This past summer I had the privilege to intern at an agency called Klick Health as a web developer and in the fall I joined MLH as a fellow. 
Throughout the years I participated as a software developer in many hackathons and school clubs and built web apps that solve real problems. 
Recently, I have been very interested in the world of machine learning and AI. 
I plan on focusing and exploring this interest by building projects and doing research. 
<br></br>
<br></br>
Outside of school and programming I really enjoy rock climbing. I am also a big a cat person and have two cats.
